> Please use the below questions to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

I could say I have a pretty good and interesting experience with testing the web app. The cases given, the test cases are reflections of real-world scenario and it is very common to experience this kind of cases in any given web app.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?

I wrote human readable test cases. I followed and watched the instructions closely and be sure to indicate the variables on top, so there is less repetition. I did also the tasks in Gitlab, all the todos and I keep an eye on the error or success messages in each cases.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management

Yes. I've worked before in some tools, like Jest and Cypress. I worked mostly using React JS and Jest has extensive support in React and other framework. Cypress on the other hand has a really good UI, very easy to learn and straight forward. Though it is relatively new and not as extensive as Jest.

Lastly, I used these tools very seldom, when I was applying for job, so I am not fluent in those tools.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

I used Visual Studio Code to edit files.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

I found some trouble. First is I found it hard to understand the tasks at first, there are many folders and there are many files in each folders. I got confuse on what are the tasks I need to do. I message the teacher for guidance and also, watched the recorded video to find relevant information and it was very useful. After that, I got the information on how to proceed.

For the tasks itself, I could say that it was clearly noted on how to complete the tasks. The instructions are clear and well-defined. The test cases, positive and negative are easy to follow as well.

## 6. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other)

I cannot comment on other frameworks as I am not knowledgeable but in my opinion, Cypress is one of the best if you want to start testing and using test framework. The UI is really good for beginners and many tutorials are available. Some test frameworks looks boring, but Cypress has really nice UI.

Jest is also a good framework, many uses it, the community is massive so many can help you if you have questions and support is extensive.

## 7. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

I was surprised with the job advertisement for testers mainly because I am not really familiar with testing and in the testing industry. The majority of advertisements requires knowledge of Robot, Selenium and testing Python. Also, large part of the jobs advertised are focused on the backend site, and so Cypress and Jest are very limited requirements.

Apart from the frameworks, good communication skills is required, as testers communicate with other members of the development team, especially if bugs are found.

Knowledge in different web development frameworks are necessary.

## 8. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

Technical Skills
Firstly, I will check the job market in my current city for the skills the companies required for their future applicant. Here in Finland, it seems Robot, Selenium and Python are popular, and so I will study those technologies and I will put it in my resume. I will also add that I have experience with front and back end stacks, as these are also relevant in testing.

Soft Skills
I will add these skills:

Good communication skills as I have to communicate effectively with the team.
Excellent attention to details.
A habit to make every product with the highest quality.
Good analytical skills.
Highly adaptable.
Excited to learn more things.

## 9. Are you going to apply for ISTQB Foundation level Certification?

Honestly, it is not yet on my mind to apply for an ISTQB Foundation level Certification. It is not currently needed on my current job and I am more interested in web development, than in testing. I also need other certification, like Microsoft Axure and Cloud technologies, so I may have limited time to learn testing theories.

Having said that, I am not closing any doors in the future.
